# Data Structure and Types

### What are Data Structures?
Data structure is a storage that is used to store and organize data. It is a way of arranging data on a computer so that it can be accessed and updated efficiently.

Depending on your requirement and project, it is important to choose the right data structure for your project. For example, if you want to store data sequentially in the memory, then you can go for the Array data structure.

> **NOTE**: Note: Data structure and data types are slightly different. Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order.

### Types of Data Structures
Basically, data structures are divided into two categories:

- Linear Data Structures
- Non-Linear Data Structures

#### Linear Data Structures
Linear data structures are those data structures in which data elements are arranged in a sequential manner. In other words, we can say that the elements are arranged in a linear order. The elements are linked using pointers.

In linear data structures, the elements are arranged in sequence one after the other. Since elements are arranged in particular order, they are easy to implement.

However, when the complexity of the program increases, the linear data structures might not be the best choice because of operational complexities.

Some of the linear data structures are:

### 1. Array Data Structure
In an array, elements in memory are arranged in continuous memory. All the elements of an array are of the same type. And, the type of elements that can be stored in the form of arrays is determined by the programming language.
